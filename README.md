# Convolutional Neural Network using EMNIST and Binary Alphadigits dataset


Techniques used for fine-tuning:

Adding Dense layers

Weight initialization

Choice of activation function

Choice of optimizer

Batch normalization

Regularization

Dropout

Early Stopping

Transfer learning was used to apply the existing model to a new data set

Data augmentation was used to create variations of the smaller data set; mended overfitting problems
